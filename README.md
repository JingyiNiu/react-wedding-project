# React Wedding Project
This is a rewritten react project based on my another project: **wedding-products-js-demo**(https://github.com/JingyiNiu/wedding-products-js-demo).
It shows all products at home page and user could filter the products by category, price range and also sort items by price low to high or high to low. At details page, it shows information of a certain item.
